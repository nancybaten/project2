    <p>One of my hobbies is watching true crime.</p>
    <p>I consider it a hobby of mine because it takes up most of my time.</p>
    <p>I've always been fascinated with what happens in court and the retracing of events before the crime was commited.</p>
    <p>My hobby started off as pure curiosity but transformed to genuine interest.</p>
    <p>True crime made me read more and want to educate myself on certain topics that get brought up in cases to understand them better.</p>
    <p>One of the podcasts I listen to frequently because of its thorough research is named Rotten Mango</p>
    <p>Some of the reasons I regularly watch true crime is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay informed on what is going on around the world</li>
      <li>Find ways to advocate for people</li>
      <li>Hear the story of survivors </li>
    </ul>
